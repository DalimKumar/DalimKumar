                <p className="play-text-p">
                  The time is now, Neo Narcos are ready for the invasion. The
                  Chosen One, an inter-dimensional traveller from 1bn lizard
                  years away has declared siege on Kratos; capturing its land,
                  seizing its $Spice fields, milking its fortune and taking
                  control of its people.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  You play the role of one of the genesis narcos, the coolest
                  bad guys in the galaxy. There are four crime families who
                  control the planet Kratos, with varying strengths and skills -
                  Collect them all, earn $Spice, upgrade your army and repel the
                  invasion.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Stake your Narco army in the invasion to yield $Spice. Bribe
                  the Chosen One to bank your loot, or build your street cred to
                  keep it all.

                <h2 className="title text-left play-text">Genesis Narcos</h2>
                <p className="play-text-p">
                  There are four crime families who share control of the planet
                  Kratos, each with their own skills. They will need to put
                  aside their differences and fight together against the coming
                  invasion. <br />
                  <br />
                  By staking your Narcos into the invasion effort you yield
                  $Spice. All staked Narcos will earn 2x the daily $Spice yield
                  for the first 48 hours of the start of the staking game. Our
                  aim is for all staked Narco owners to be able to access all
                  future drops for free with the claimed $Spice.
