            Are your Niche Edits just hacked links? <br />
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            No. It is possible to secure niche edits via unethical means but
            that isn’t the Link City way and, objectively, it only yields
            short-term ranking increases. Instead, we develop long-lasting
            relationships with our clients by delivering great results via
            legitimate means.
            <br />
            <br /> More specifically, our backlinks are always built with the
            permission of the host webmaster which means they pose zero risk to
            your site’s credibility and will last for many years to come.

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            At Link City, just like our guest posts, we build our links by using
            organic, genuine link outreach methods. This means that the host
            domain owner has both given consent and has agreed to keep the link
            live for the duration of their website’s operation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, Link City backlinks come with a 90-day life guarantee.
            However, rest assured that our team will work to keep your links
            functioning long after that period has expired.

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            It takes approximately 7-14 days for our team to secure a
            fully-functioning link. That being said, depending on the complexity
            of the task, this period can extend to 30 days.

            How safe is it to buy these links for my site?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            Technically, link building is in conflict with Google’s guidelines,
            however, you shouldn’t let that put you off as legitimate link
            building is widely considered a white-hat practice. As such, where
            implemented legitimately, Google doesn’t penalise link building.
            <br />
            <br />
            Furthermore, backlinks remain one of Google’s most influential
            ranking factors and so they are a vital component of any site that
            hopes to achieve that all-important #1 ranking position. To that
            end, the Link City team works to ensure that our clients’ links are
            both safe and effective.
            <br />
            <br /> So, if you’re worried, you couldn’t be in better hands.

            Can you Drip feed Niche edits?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            It is possible for us to drip feed your niche edits over time.
            However, due to the nature of Google’s indexing process, this is
            largely a redundant strategy as Google will most likely index all
            your new niche edits simultaneously.
            <br />
            <br /> As a result, the likelihood is that your new niche edits will
            go live at the same time, even if they are delivered incrementally.
