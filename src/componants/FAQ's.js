            Is link building safe?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-400 sm:text-lg md:text-normal">
            Google has never encouraged webmasters to build backlinks. After
            all, they’re never going to openly tell you to try to outsmart their
            own algorithm. However, while link building is technically against
            Google’s guidelines, it remains a major ranking factor.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, if you’re not building links, you’re at a serious
            disadvantage in relation to the competition. More to the point,
            there are three types of people in SEO: those who build links, those
            who claim they don’t build links but build them anyway and those who
            mask their link building practices by using Digital PR techniques or
            something similar. As such, it’s clear that link building is an
            essential component to digital success, but is it safe? The answer
            is yes. It’s completely safe if you do it right and guess what? We
            do it right.

            Yes, link building is still a major ranking factor in 2022. Do not

            At Link City, we continue to monitor our clients’ links long after
            their order has been completed. While we do this in order to provide
            the optimal results for our clients, it’s also in our best interests
            to ensure your link stays live as, ultimately, it contributes to the
            ongoing high standards of our service. <br />
            <br /> That said, we provide a 90-day money-back guarantee if we
            cannot replace or fix a link that has broken. Happily, however, this
            is a rare event and if it does occur, it’s typically the result of
            an accident.
